A backend for the NFC door access readers, currently written in Django. 

How to use: 
- Read the django tutorial for details about setting up your database connection
  and activating the web administration interface.
  This was developed against MySQL, but let me know if it doesn't work on 
  the other database types
- Login to the web administration interface, or if you prefer,
  using the Django command line, or even your SQL server, and add
  the cards for the system to the database.
  The arguments are:
  tag_uid: The 4-byte NFC tag ID[1], in lower case hex (i.e 1a23cd45)
  owner: some text to designate the owner of the card, i.e email address
  revoked (boolean): set to true if the card is lost or compromised,
 	and sharks with freakin' lasers should pop out if someone
	attempts to use it.
- Fire up your frontend and enjoy
- All card actions (success, authentication failure, blocked card)
  are logged to the cardevent table


[1] - 7 byte UIDs are supported by the NFC protocol, and 
	other card types (i.e DESFire) have even longer UIDs.
	Be careful when creating database models around this.
